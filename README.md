# A-MongOS:

A-MongOS is an Operating Systems project, simulating all the functionality of an Operating System. This project contains: 
* Sockets to communicate between processes
* Semaphores, to thread synchronization
* Memory management to avoid memory leaks (free())
* Virtual memory such as paging and segmentation, as well as memory compactation and the concepts of internal and external fragmentation. 
* Short-term scheduling algorithms such as Round Robin and FIFO.
* Implementation of a File System to be able to persist the data.
